# ManaFluidics

ManaFluidics is a storage and logistics mod for Minecraft 1.10.

A note to those viewing this repo:
This is a development repository.  I do not use a private repo to push buggy or untested changes to.  This is where they go.  While I hope to always push viable or vaguely functional builds here, it may happen that a build from this repository is completely trash.  I recommend, if one wants to build a custom version from this repo, to use a tag version for greater stability.
There are no tags yet, because the mod is VERY unfinished.  I'll get there.
